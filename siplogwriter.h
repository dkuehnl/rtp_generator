 * *********************RTP-Generator******************************
 *
 *The purpose of the RTP-Generator is to establish a working call
 *and send a customized RTP-stream. This can be used to test the
 *behavior of IMS network-elements in edge-cases and to force
 *the user-agent behavior out of the world.
 *Due to the dynamic routing inside an IMS there are also some config-
 *options for the call-setup like:
 *- activating/deactivating UPDATE
 *- activating/deactivating 100rel and timer
 *- configure available codecs (speach and dtmf out-of-band)
 *
 *For RTP are more options available such as:
 *- change SSRC and/or sequence-number after time or packets
 *- pause rtp-stream for time or complete
 *- etc. (see mainwindow-ui or README for complete config-option)
 *
 *
 *Purpose of the file siplogwriter.h/cpp:
 *This Class is derived from the original PJSIP logwriter and has the
 *responsibility to catch the PJSIP-logmessages, classify them and hand
 *them over to the FlowChart-Object.
 *Handover is done by a signal and the characteristics for deciding whether
 *or not handover it is done by the Payload - only SIP-Messages are forwarded.
 *All other PJSIP-message are dropped/ignored.

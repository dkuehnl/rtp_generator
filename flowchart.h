 * *********************RTP-Generator******************************
 *
 *The purpose of the RTP-Generator is to establish a working call
 *and send a customized RTP-stream. This can be used to test the
 *behavior of IMS network-elements in edge-cases and to force
 *the user-agent behavior out of the world.
 *Due to the dynamic routing inside an IMS there are also some config-
 *options for the call-setup like:
 *- activating/deactivating UPDATE
 *- activating/deactivating 100rel and timer
 *- configure available codecs (speach and dtmf out-of-band)
 *
 *For RTP are more options available such as:
 *- change SSRC and/or sequence-number after time or packets
 *- pause rtp-stream for time or complete
 *- etc. (see mainwindow-ui or README for complete config-option)
 *
 *
 *Purpose of the file flowchart.h/cpp:
 *The FlowChart-Class is responsible for receiving the sip-logmessages from
 *from the custom logwriter-class declared in SipLogwriter.cpp.
 *It stores the sip-messages and draw it directly into mainwindow.ui.
 *This is possible because when instantiating this object from mainwindow.cpp
 *the ui has to be handed over to this class for referencing to the ui.

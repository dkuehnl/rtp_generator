 * *********************RTP-Generator******************************
 *
 *The purpose of the RTP-Generator is to establish a working call
 *and send a customized RTP-stream. This can be used to test the
 *behavior of IMS network-elements in edge-cases and to force
 *the user-agent behavior out of the world.
 *Due to the dynamic routing inside an IMS there are also some config-
 *options for the call-setup like:
 *- activating/deactivating UPDATE
 *- activating/deactivating 100rel and timer
 *- configure available codecs (speach and dtmf out-of-band)
 *
 *For RTP are more options available such as:
 *- change SSRC and/or sequence-number after time or packets
 *- pause rtp-stream for time or complete
 *- etc. (see mainwindow-ui or README for complete config-option)
 *
 *
 *Purpose of the file sipcall.h/cpp:
 *The SipCall-Class is a derived class from PJSIP-Call-class and is
 *responsible for the custom call-setup maintained and configured over
 *the ui in mainwindow.
 *This class is triggered and maintained by SipMachine-Class.
 *Currently it maintaines if 100rel/timer is acitvated or not. If this
 *will remain here depened on how I get this config-options get work with
 *PJSIP (because the default behaivor is to set both options in supported-
 *header and only get a easy way to elevate them in require-header. But
 *there is no option to fully delete both of them out of the INVITE-message)
